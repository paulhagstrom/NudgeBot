# NudgeBot

This is a Discord bot written for KansasFest 2020.

It handles two commands at present.

!nudge #new-channel

will create a bi-directional link between the current channel and the new-channel,
to help in moving a conversation from an off-topic area to an on-topic area.

!entry

will place an attached image into #background-entries
and provide it with one thumbs-up vote.
A second invocation of !entry will replace the previous entry, only one entry per author.
